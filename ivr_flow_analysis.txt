IVR FLOW DIAGRAM - DETAILED EXTRACTION
======================================

ANALYZING THE IMAGE SYSTEMATICALLY:

The image shows a dark background with multiple colored boxes representing an IVR flow.
The boxes are connected with arrows showing the call flow path.

Let me identify each section:

TOP SECTION (Starting from center-top):
- There appear to be several rectangular boxes with text
- Colors: Yellow (decision/menu nodes), Pink/Purple (action nodes)
- Multiple branching paths

LEFT SECTION:
- Appears to be the entry point
- Sequential flow of nodes

MIDDLE SECTION:
- Multiple branching paths
- Several parallel flows

RIGHT SECTION:
- Appears to show various endpoints
- Multiple terminal nodes

ATTEMPTING TO READ TEXT IN NODES:
Unfortunately, due to the image resolution and dark background, I cannot clearly read all the text within each node. The text appears to be small and the contrast makes it difficult to discern specific words.

WHAT I CAN OBSERVE:
- Node colors: Yellow/Beige (likely decision/menu nodes), Pink/Purple (likely action nodes)
- Flow structure: Tree-like with multiple branches
- Complexity: Appears to be a comprehensive IVR system with 15-20+ nodes
- Connections: Multiple arrows showing flow between nodes

REQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION:
To accurately recreate this hospital IVR flow, I need either:
1. A higher resolution version of the image
2. A text description of the node labels and flow structure
3. The original diagram file (if available)
